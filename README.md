Brazilian E-Commerce (Olist) Analysis Project
This project analyzes real-world Brazilian e-commerce (Olist) data to uncover insights about customer behavior, delivery performance, seller distribution, and product market trends.
The goal is to simulate real-world business analysis using Python and professional visualization.

Main Questions:

1. Delivery Performance
How do delivery times vary across states and cities?
What is the distribution of delivery delays?

2. Customer Spending Patterns
Which states and cities have higher or lower average customer payments?
How are spending patterns distributed across regions?

3. Product Market Trends
Which product categories are most popular overall and by region?
How diverse is product availability across different states?

4. Seller Distribution
Which cities host the largest number of sellers?

Key Takeaways:
Delivery delays are relatively rare (~8%), but vary significantly by region.
Customer spending is not evenly distributed â€” some states and cities spend considerably more.
Certain product categories dominate sales nationally, but regional diversity is high.
Seller density varies, with major metropolitan areas hosting the majority of sellers.
